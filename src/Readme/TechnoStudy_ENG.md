## Technologies and Tools Used

#### *The key technologies and tools used in this project include:*

- **Java** - Programming language.
- **Selenium WebDriver** - Browser automation tool.
- **TestNG** - Testing framework for writing and running tests.
- **Apache POI** - A Java library for reading and writing Excel files.
- **Git & GitHub** - Version control systems for project collaboration.
- **JIRA & Zephyr** - Tools for test management, tracking, and defect reporting.
- **Page Object Model (POM)** - A design pattern for structuring automated test cases.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure that JDK is installed on your system for Java development.
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA should be used for writing and managing Java code.
- **Git:** Git should be installed to manage version control and push the project to GitHub.
- **Selenium WebDriver:** Use Selenium for learning and applying browser automation.
- **TestNG:** Learn TestNG framework and how to write test cases using it.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Apply this pattern to maintain a structured test framework.
- **JIRA & Zephyr:** Use JIRA for test management and defect reporting.

## Project Requirements

1. **Page Object Model (POM):** Apply the POM design pattern for structuring the test cases.
2. **Parallel Testing:** Run tests in parallel across both Chrome and Firefox browsers.
3. **XML Configuration:** Configure and run test cases from XML files.
4. **Smoke and Regression Testing:** Create separate XML files for smoke and regression tests.
5. **Live Environment Considerations:** Use "test" in name and email fields for easy data cleanup, and set the country to "Argentina".
